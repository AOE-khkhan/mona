README
1) Upload the entire robb_joyding_evolisa.tgz onto SEAS and untar. The tgz contains the python modules
PIL (python image library) and jinja2 (templating). They have been compiled for resonance, and the extracted
tgz should work. If something goes from, you may need to actually install the two modules yourself on
whatever system you are using, and delete the PIL and Jinja2 folders.
2) Log in to resonance
3) Load PyCuda modules: module load packages/pycuda/0.93; module load packages/cuda/2.2
4) Run with command: python evo.py imagename.jpg. No parameters are available by command line, but
easily editable in the python script. The resultant images (one ever 100 iterations) will be outputted to
./temp_images. The stdout gives the fitness of the solution after every iteration.
We have provided a test image small and large test image:
python evo.py slisa.jpg for small image
python evo.py lisa.jpg for large image
The small image will render to decent quality in a minute or so, the large image takes about 10-20 minutes.
